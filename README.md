# BombCrypto-Bot

# How it works:

This is a bot based on mouse position and it use some image recognition, this is why you need to set up the postion of the buttons of the game before using it!

First of all you need to sign a first time on the game, because your wallet will ask your password the first time.

After that you can run your bot, it will sign for you, get all your heroes working and then click into the game.

It will also automatically check if you are not logged off and if you are will login you again, click on a new map for you and also put your heroes for work every 23 minutes!

If are enjoying the bot you can send me Bcoins :)
